📊 Udemy Courses Analysis Dashboard

## Interactive Tableau Dashboard | Online Dataset Project

This project presents an end-to-end analysis of Udemy course performance using an online dataset sourced from a public learning-platform repository.
The goal was to explore how course subjects, price types, levels, and reviews influence subscriber engagement. 
The insights are visualized in a clean, interactive Tableau dashboard.

# 🚀 Project Overview

This dashboard provides a comprehensive look into Udemy’s course ecosystem, enabling users to identify:

   ● Top-performing subjects

   ● Growth in subscribers over time

   ● Subscriber distribution by course level

   ● Performance comparison between free vs. paid courses

   ● Courses with the highest number of subscribers

   ● Review impact on subscriber count

The final result is an interactive Tableau dashboard that allows dynamic filtering across Subject, Course Level, and Course Price (Free/Paid)
